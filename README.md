Question 1 - What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course,the primary problem addressing was the efficient management and manipulation of data using various data structures and in terms of run-time and memory usage,as well as implementing sorting algorithms to organize data-in this case,a list of courses in the Computer Science program.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To tackle the problem,I began by researching and selecting appropriate data structures that would best suit the needs of the projects. Understanding data structures is crucial because they provide the foundation for organizing and storing data efficiently,which directly impacts the performance of algorithms. For instance,I utilized arrays and linked lists for Project One to analyze their run-time complexities and memory usage,while in Project Two,I implemented a sort the course list in alphanumeric order.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
During the projects,I encountered several roadblocks,particurlarly with understanding the complexities of different algorithms and their implications on performance. To overcome these challenges,I sought additional resources such as online tutorials and documentation,and engaged in discussions with peer to clarify concepts. Additionally,I practiced implementing various algorithms to gain hands-on experience,which helped soldidfy my understanding and allowed me to troubleshoot issues.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The projects required me to analyze the performance of different data structures in terms of run-time and memory usage,as well as to develop a sorting algorithm to organize a list of course in the Computer Science program. My approach to these problems emphasized the importance of selecting the right data structures for specific taasks,as they can significantly impact the efficiency and performance of the software.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable,readable,and adaptable?
My work on these projects has significantly evolved my approach to designing software and developing programs. I have learned tp prioritize maintainability,readability and adaptability in my code. By focusing on clear that my programs are easier to understand and modify in the future. Additionally,I have become more adapt at choosing appropriate data structures based on the specific requirements of a project,which has led to more efficient has effective solutions. This experience has instilled in me a greater appreciation for the role of data structures in software development and has equipped me with the skills to create robust and scalable applicatiojns.
